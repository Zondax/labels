# labels

This repository contains only labels. These labels (https://github.com/Zondax/labels/labels) serve as a template or preference settings (name and color) for all other labels in github.com/Zondax/.

Repositoris that are missing labels from this list are being completed to contain the full list. If the label is already present but the color is different, the color will be synchronized.

Use these labels in https://github.com/Zondax/labels/labels to set the label preferences organization wide.
